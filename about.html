				<h3>I AM KAREN LIVEY</h3>
				<p>
					I have always been fascinated by people – what they do, what they
					don’t do, and everything in-between. No surprise I did a degree in psychology, a Master of Business Administration, numerous other tions, and finally, a qualification in Neuroscience of Leadership.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite having worked in industry for many years in South Africa
					and the UK, when I came to Australia I effectively returned to
					my roots – went back into speaking and training to spread the
					message, to make a difference (I had been a Secondary school
					teacher for a time in Cape Town).
				</p>
				<p>
					I has worked in many different types of businesses. In the UK I worked in an IT related company which was male-dominated – plenty of testosterone marching around those offices. As you can imagine, there were some interesting challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					I played squash at an international level and enjoyed playing in the Men’s teams as well. This was a totally different game. It certainly brought out my gung-ho, competitive attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you put all of me into a bag and shake it up, you end up with an optimistic can-do person who wants to change work places into ronments people want to be in and bring on their best selves through fantastic leadership.
				</p>
				<p>
					Leaders’ attitudes, values and work ethics colour the rest of the team – the way they think and do. Today, I wants to change one leader at a time into high performing greatness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides making new worlds at work, I love going to the beach for long walks, swimming with the dogs and	enjoying my mochas with family. And, now and then, I gets onto that bicycle of mine and breathes in the fresh	coastal air whilst ‘whizzing’ along the coast.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>HOW I GOT INTO NEUROSCIENCE</h3>
				<p>
					I have always been fascinated with people – how they think, what they do, why they do it. Whilst involved in leadership training, the idea of the brain kept popping up. I wanted to find out more about it and what it meant	to me and others. I signed up to do a qualification in Neuroscience of Leadership, and my whole world became brighter. I could not believe how much knowledge was out there that needed to be explored and understood.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe it is so crucial to becoming a top performing leader, I wanted to share the knowledge and let them all know how much better everything could be!
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>WHY I SPECIALISE IN THIS FIELD</h3>
				<p>
					Neuroscience gave me the ‘inside’ knowledge for the psychology of behaviour. It brought insight into why I did what I did, and how I impacted on others (both negatively and positively).
				</p>
				<p>
					I think leadership is the backbone of all organisations. Great leadership leads to great organisations - they	perform better, they solve problems better and they are ready for new directions. I wanted all leaders to	recognise this; to strive for better performance and enhance their work environments through better selfawareness,				engagement and success.
				</p>
				<p>
					Putting my knowledge of neuroscience together with that of leadership and the psychology of behaviour made complete sense – a perfect amalgamation of all things good.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>HOW CAN WHAT I DO HELP YOU, YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR BUSINESS</h3>
				<p>
					There is this concept of if you only have a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. Well, I give you a whole	range of different tools, ideas and strategies to use for different times and situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not just theory; it’s real-world application. We find strategies and techniques that will work for you in your place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of this, it’s solid professional development outlining best practice and ways each person can use their	new knowledge in ways that work for them. It’s not a matter of ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result, you can perform better, engage better and achieve higher productivity levels. This impacts positively	for all the people you are connected to at work, and the organisation as a whole.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>I WORK WITH...</h3>
				<p>
					I work with people who want to be great leaders, people who want to be the best they can be. They value	professional development and can see how it can improve their own time at work and also those who work with	them and for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					My focus of rewiring leadership is showing leaders how they can use a neuroscience lens to give deeper understanding and knowledge in behaviours. They can learn how some small tweaks can make exponential	positive difference to themselves and others.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bottom line is I want people to skip to work because they enjoy it so much and we know how much leaders	impact others. Effectively, I want to Make Mondays Magic.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have worked with my fair share of poor leaders – those who use the command and control processes and wonder why productivity can’t be improved. There are others whose lack of consistency keeps everyone on tenterhooks with no ‘good’ work being done.
				</p>
				<p>
					Leadership shapes the organisation. It can create environments of support and safety for everyone to engage	and work well. It can also make work toxic, with very high levels of employee turnover. Talented people can’t	settle into this type of environment and soon look for alternatives where they are valued and respected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together we can make leaders who are enablers, encourage others and energise their teams.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Let’s Make Mondays Magic.</b>
